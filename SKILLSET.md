# What is the Skillset of a "Data Scientist", anyway?

According to [udacity](https://blog.udacity.com/2014/11/data-science-job-skills.html),
these are essential skills every data scientist must have:

## Programming Skills

You are currently using the most popular and widespread programming language in
the world. If you know how to use this package, this should qualify.

## Statistics

What is better than theoretical statistical skills? Practical applicable
software modules. You know what you want out of your data, implementation
details don't matter much.

## Machine Learning

TODO: pick ML libraries

## Multivariable Calculus & Linear Algebra

TODO: pick Predictive libraries

## Data Wrangling

* ordering data
* iterators for chunk modifications
* regular expressions
* date/time parsing

## Data Visualization & Communication

Developers mostly want JSON or CSV data, less technical people need excel files
for tinkering and managers at most "read" rendered graphs, slides, or PDFs.

## Software Engineering

The more SE skills you have, the better a data scientist you will be. In smaller
companies, there is a lot of groundwork to do, while in enterprises there are
huge piles of messy data cluttered over many incompatible systems.

## Data Intuition

Deciding what makes sense - what to use and when - this is your actual job.
